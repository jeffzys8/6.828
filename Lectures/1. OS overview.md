# Lecture 1: O/S overview

## Overview

* 6.828 goals
  * Understand operating system design and implementation
  * Hands-on experience by building small O/S

> 课程的精髓就在于自己动手建一个小型 O/S

* What is the purpose of an O/S?
  * Support applications
  * **Abstract** the hardware for convenience and portability <br> *抽象一直是我所追求的*
  * Multiplex the hardware among multiple applications
  * Isolate applications in order to contain bugs
  * Allow sharing among applications
  * Provide high performance

* What is the O/S design approach?
  * the small view: a h/w management library
  * the big view: physical machine -> abstract one w/ better properties

* Organization: layered picture
   h/w: CPU, mem, disk, &c
   kernel services
   user applications: vi, gcc, &c
  * we care a lot about the interfaces and internal kernel structure

* What services does an O/S kernel typically provide?
    > 操作系统的基本服务，重点
  * processes
  * memory allocation
  * file contents
  * directories and file names
  * security
  * many others: users, IPC, network, time, terminals

* What does an O/S abstraction look like?
  * Applications see them only via system calls
  * Examples, from UNIX (e.g. Linux, OSX, FreeBSD):

            fd = open("out", 1);
            write(fd, "hello\n", 6);
            pid = fork();

* Why is O/S design/implementation hard/interesting?
  * the environment is unforgiving: quirky h/w, weak debugger
  * it must be efficient (thus low-level?)
	...but abstract/portable (thus high-level?)
  * powerful (thus many features?)
	...but simple (thus a few composable building blocks?)
  * features interact: `fd = open(); ...; fork()`
  * behaviors interact: CPU priority vs memory allocator
  * open problems: security; performance; exploiting new hardware

* You'll be glad you learned about operating systems if you...
  * want to work on the above problems
  * care about what's going on under the hood
  * have to build high-performance systems
  * need to diagnose bugs or security problems

## Class structure

* See web site: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828

* Lectures
  * O/S ideas
  * **detailed inspection of xv6**, a traditional O/S
  * xv6 programming homework to motivate lectures
  * papers on some recent topics

* Labs: **JOS**, a small O/S for x86 in an exokernel style
  * you build it, 5 labs + final lab of your choice
  * kernel interface: expose hardware, but protect -- few abstractions!
  * unprivileged user-level library: fork, exec, pipe, ...
  * applications: file system, shell, ..
  * development environment: **gcc, qemu**
  * lab 1 is out

  **(demo: build JOS and run ls)**

* Xv6 and JOS
  Two different designs.
  Hopefully will force you understand issues better, but will be confusing too.
  Neither has the complexity of a real OS
  
  **(demo: build Linux)**
> - Xv6用于上课，JOS用于实验课；两个是不同的设计。在Xv6的介绍里，了解到JOS是较老的版本，所以重心还是放在xv6上比较好，JOS实验可以参照他人的实践完成
> - 这个课程上把Linux都编译运行了一下——未尝不可以自己尝试着去做一下
* Two exams: midterm during class meeting, final in finals week

## Introduction to system calls

* 6.828 is largely about design and implementation of **system call interface**. Let's look at how programs use that interface. we'll focus on **UNIX** (Linux, Mac, POSIX, &c).

* a simple example: what system calls does "ls" call?
  * Trace system calls:
    * On OSX: sudo dtruss /bin/ls
    * On Linux: strace /bin/ls
  * so many system calls!

> 在ubuntu的```/bin/```里找到了```ls```，但是没有找到```cd```?这是为什么呢
> 

> 下面的几个例子是课上的演示，找不到相关的代码——能找得到再来补充。这些例子使用C语言对一些简单的命令进行编写，并且使用```dtruss```命令跟踪系统调用，Linux系统下使用```strace```

* example: copy input to output
    ```            
    cat copy.c
    cc -o copy copy.c
    ./copy
    ```
    read a line, then write a line<br>
    note: **written in C**, the traditional O/S language

    * first read/write argument is a "**file descriptor**" (fd),passed to kernel to tell it what "open file" to read/write
    * (the file) must previously have been opened, connects to file/device/socket/&c
    * **UNIX convention: fd 0 is "standard input", 1 is "standard output"**

  ```shell
  //跟踪系统调用

  $ sudo dtruss ./copy
  read(0x0, "123\n\0", 0x80)		 = 4 0
  write(0x1, "123\n@\213\002\0", 0x4)		 = 4 0
  ```
* example: creating a file
    ```
    cat open.c
    cc -o open open.c
    ./open
    cat output.txt
    ```

    * note: creat() turned into open()
    * note: can see actual FD with dtruss(strace)
    * note: this code **ignores errors** -- don't be this sloppy!

* example: redirecting standard output
    ```shell
    cat redirect.c
    cc -o redirect redirect.c
    ./redirect
    cat output.txt
    man dup2
    sudo dtruss ./redirect
    ```
    - note: writes output.txt via fd 1
    - note: **stderr** (standard error) is fd 2 -- that's why creat() yields FD 3


* a more interesting program: **the Unix shell**.
  * it's the Unix command-line user interface
  * it's a good illustration of the UNIX system call API
  * some example commands:
    ```
    ls
    ls > junk
    ls | wc -l
    ls | wc -l > junk
    ```
  * the **shell is also a programming/scripting language**
    ```shell
    cat > script
      echo one
      echo two
    sh < script
    ```
  * the shell **uses system calls** to set up redirection, pipes, waiting. programs like wc are ignorant of input/output setup


## Inspection of sh.c
Let's look at **source** for a simple shell, sh.c

> [sh.c](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/homework/sh.c) 

* main()
  - **basic organization: parse into tree, then run**
  - main process: getcmd, fork, wait
  - child process: parsecmd, runcmd 
  - why the **fork()**? <br>
      we need **a new process for the command**
  - what does fork() do?<br>
      ```c
        if(fork1() == 0)
          runcmd(parsecmd(buf));
      ```
      - copies user memory
      - copies kernel state e.g. file descriptors;
      - so "child" is almost identical to "parent" (这一句的意思是？)
      - child has different "process ID"
      - both processes now run, in parallel
      - fork returns twice, once in parent, once in child
      - fork returns child PID to parent
      - fork returns 0 to child
      - **so sh calls runcmd() in the child process**
  - why the wait()?
  - what if child exits before parent calls wait()?

* runcmd()
  - **executes** parse tree generated by parsecmd()
  - distinct cmd types for simple command, redirection,
  pipe

* runcmd() for simple command with arguments
  > runcmd()是需要在后续作业中自行实现的函数，相当于简化版的execvp; <br>
  > execvp是C语言中指令的一种,有调用另一个程序的功能。<br>
  > 如下描述了execvp的工作过程：它将某个文件（比如指令ls 命令的 /bin/ls 文件）拷贝到当前进程的内存，并且跳到该文件的main进行执行

  - execvp(cmd, args)
  - man execvp  //'man'是查看手册的命令
  - ls command &c exist as executable files, e.g. /bin/ls
  - execvp loads executable file over memory of current process， and jumps to start of executable -- main()
  - note: execvp doesn't return if all goes well
  - note: execvp() only returns if it can't find the executable file
  - note: it's the **shell child that's replaced** with execvp()
  - note: the **main shell process is still wait**()ing for the child
  
* how does runcmd() handle I/O redirection?<br>
  ```
  这一部分不看具体的代码是无法理解的, 回头再看
  e.g. echo hello > junk

  parsecmd() produces tree with two nodes
    cmd->type='>', cmd->file="junk", cmd->cmd=...
    cmd->type=' ', cmd->argv=["echo", "hello"]
  the open(); dup2() causes FD 1 to be replaced with FD to output file
  it's the shell child process that changes its FD 1
  execvp preserves the FD setup
  so echo runs with FD 1 connected to file junk
  again, very nice that echo is oblivious, just writes FD 1
  ```
* why are fork and exec **separate**?
  * perhaps **wasteful** that fork copies shell memory only to have it thrown away by exec
  * the point: **the child gets a chance to change FD setup before calling exec** (猜测这部分和pipe有关)
  * and the parent's FD set is not disturbed
  * **you'll implement tricks to avoid fork() copy cost in the labs**

* how does the shell implement pipelines?
  ```shell
  $ ls | wc -l
  ```
  the kernel provides a pipe abstraction
  ```c
  //a pair of file descriptors: a write FD, and a read FD
  //data written to the write FD appears on the read FD
  int fds[2]
  pipe(fds)
  ```

* example: pipe1.c
  > 没有代码无法看

  read() blocks until data is available<br>
  write() blocks if pipe buffer is full

* **pipe file descriptors are inherited across fork** (这是什么意思) <br>
  so pipes can be used to **communicate between processes** <br>
  example: pipe2.c (又缺了) <br>
  for many programs, just like file I/O, so pipes work for stdin/stdout

* for ls | wc -l, shell must:
  - create a pipe
  - fork
  - set up fd 1 to be the pipe write FD
  - exec ls
  - set up wc's fd 0 to be pipe read FD
  - exec wc
  - wait for wc
  
  [diagram: sh parent, sh child, ls grandchild, wc grandchild, stdin/out for each] (这是什么)<br>

  - note: sh close()es unused FDs, so **exit of writer produces EOF at reader**

* you'll **implement pieces of a shell** in an upcoming homework
